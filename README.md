rssiboard
=========

This tiny board can convert PWM-based RSSI signals (such as those produced by the RSSI ports on FrSky Rx modules) into an analog signal. This is very useful if your flight controller only understands analog RSSI, such as the APM 2.x.

It's a simple but very useful board that connects easily. For APM 2.x, simply connect the PWM side to the RSSI port on your receiver, and the other to an analog port on the APM, and enable RSSI in the mission planner!
